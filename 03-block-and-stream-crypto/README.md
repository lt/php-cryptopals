# Crypto Challenge Set 3
This is the next set of **block cipher cryptography** challenges (even the randomness stuff here plays into block cipher crypto).

This set is **moderately difficult**. It includes a famous attack against CBC mode, and a "cloning" attack on a popular RNG that can be annoying to get right.

We've also reached a point in the crypto challenges where all the challenges, with one possible exception, are valuable in breaking real-world crypto.

17\. The CBC padding oracle<br />
18\. Implement CTR, the stream cipher mode<br />
19\. Break fixed-nonce CTR mode using substitions<br />
20\. Break fixed-nonce CTR statistically<br />
21\. Implement the MT19937 Mersenne Twister RNG<br />
22\. Crack an MT19937 seed<br />
23\. Clone an MT19937 RNG from its output<br />
24\. Create the MT19937 stream cipher and break it<br />

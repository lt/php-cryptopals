# [Crypto Challenge Set 8](http://cryptopals.com/sets/8/)
This is **the second of two sets we generated after the original 6.**

This set focuses on abstract algebra, including DH, GCM, and (most importantly) elliptic curve cryptography. Fair warning - it's really tough! There's a ton of content here, and it's more demanding than anything we've released so far. By the time you're done, you will have written an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of one percent of SageMath.

- [ ] 57. Diffie-Hellman Revisited: Small Subgroup Confinement
- [ ] 58. Pollard's Method for Catching Kangaroos
- [ ] 59. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman and Invalid-Curve Attacks
- [ ] 60. Single-Coordinate Ladders and Insecure Twists
- [ ] 61. Duplicate-Signature Key Selection in ECDSA (and RSA)
- [ ] 62. Key-Recovery Attacks on ECDSA with Biased Nonces
- [ ] 63. Key-Recovery Attacks on GCM with Repeated Nonces
- [ ] 64. Key-Recovery Attacks on GCM with a Truncated MAC

But wait, where are the actual challenges?! You'll need to mail in for them, just like in the original cryptopals. Send a mail to set#.cryptopals@gmail.com and make the subject "Crazy Flamboyant for the Rap Enjoyment". BUT replace the # with the number of the set you want. Which would be 8. So replace it with 8.

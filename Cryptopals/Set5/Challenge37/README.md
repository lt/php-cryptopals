# [Break SRP with a zero key](http://cryptopals.com/sets/5/challenges/37/)
Get your SRP working in an actual client-server setting. "Log in" with a valid password using the protocol.

Now log in without your password by having the client send 0 as its "A" value. What does this to the "S" value that both sides compute?

Now log in without your password by having the client send N, N*2, &c.

Trevor Perrin and Nate Lawson taught us this attack 7 years ago. It is *excellent*. Attacks on DH are tricky to "operationalize". But this attack uses the same concepts, and results in auth bypass. Almost every implementation of SRP we've ever seen has this flaw; if you see a new one, go look for this bug. |

# [Crypto Challenge Set 5](http://cryptopals.com/sets/5/)
This is the first set of **number-theoretic cryptography** challenges, and also our coverage of message authentication.

This set is **significantly harder** than the last set. The concepts are new, the attacks bear no resemblance to those of the previous sets, and... math.

On the other hand, **our favorite cryptanalytic attack ever** is in this set (you'll see it soon). We're happy with this set. Don't wimp out here. You're almost done!

- [x] 33. Implement Diffie-Hellman
- [x] 34. Implement a MITM key-fixing attack on Diffie-Hellman with parameter injection
- [x] 35. Implement DH with negotiated groups, and break with malicious "g" parameters
- [x] 36. Implement Secure Remote Password (SRP)
- [x] 37. Break SRP with a zero key
- [x] 38. Offline dictionary attack on simplified SRP
- [x] 39. Implement RSA
- [ ] 40. Implement an E=3 RSA Broadcast attack

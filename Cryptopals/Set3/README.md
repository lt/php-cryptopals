# [Crypto Challenge Set 3](http://cryptopals.com/sets/3/)
This is the next set of **block cipher cryptography** challenges (even the randomness stuff here plays into block cipher crypto).

This set is **moderately difficult**. It includes a famous attack against CBC mode, and a "cloning" attack on a popular RNG that can be annoying to get right.

We've also reached a point in the crypto challenges where all the challenges, with one possible exception, are valuable in breaking real-world crypto.

- [x] 17. The CBC padding oracle
- [x] 18. Implement CTR, the stream cipher mode
- [x] 19. Break fixed-nonce CTR mode using substitions
- [x] 20. Break fixed-nonce CTR statistically
- [x] 21. Implement the MT19937 Mersenne Twister RNG
- [x] 22. Crack an MT19937 seed
- [x] 23. Clone an MT19937 RNG from its output
- [x] 24. Create the MT19937 stream cipher and break it

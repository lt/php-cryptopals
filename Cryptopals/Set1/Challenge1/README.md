# [Convert hex to base64](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/1/)
The string:
```
49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d
```
Should produce:
```
SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2hyb29t
```
So go ahead and make that happen. You'll need to use this code for the rest of the exercises.

Always operate on raw bytes, never on encoded strings. Only use hex and base64 for pretty-printing. |

# [Implement repeating-key XOR](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/5/)
Here is the opening stanza of an important work of the English language:
```
Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
```
Encrypt it, under the key "ICE", using repeating-key XOR.

In repeating-key XOR, you'll sequentially apply each byte of the key; the first byte of plaintext will be XOR'd against I, the next C, the next E, then I again for the 4th byte, and so on.

It should come out to:
```

Encrypt a bunch of stuff using your repeating-key XOR function. Encrypt your mail. Encrypt your password file. Your .sig file. Get a feel for it. I promise, we aren't wasting your time with this.

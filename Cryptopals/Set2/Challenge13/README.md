# [ECB cut-and-paste](http://cryptopals.com/sets/2/challenges/13/)

Write a k=v parsing routine, as if for a structured cookie. The routine should take:
```
foo=bar&baz=qux&zap=zazzle
```
... and produce:
```
{
  foo: 'bar',
  baz: 'qux',
  zap: 'zazzle'
}
```
(you know, the object; I don't care if you convert it to JSON).

Now write a function that encodes a user profile in that format, given an email address. You should have something like:
```
profile_for("foo@bar.com")
```
... and it should produce:
```
{
  email: 'foo@bar.com',
  uid: 10,
  role: 'user'
}
```
... encoded as:
```
email=foo@bar.com&uid=10&role=user
```
Your "profile_for" function should *not* allow encoding metacharacters (& and =). Eat them, quote them, whatever you want to do, but don't let people set their email address to "foo@bar.com&role=admin".

Now, two more easy functions. Generate a random AES key, then:

1. Encrypt the encoded user profile under the key; "provide" that to the "attacker".
2. Decrypt the encoded user profile and parse it.

Using only the user input to profile_for() (as an oracle to generate "valid" ciphertexts) and the ciphertexts themselves, make a role=admin profile.

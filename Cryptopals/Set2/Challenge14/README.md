# [Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Harder)](http://cryptopals.com/sets/2/challenges/14/)
Take your oracle function [from #12](../12). Now generate a random count of random bytes and prepend this string to every plaintext. You are now doing:
```
AES-128-ECB(random-prefix || attacker-controlled || target-bytes, random-key)
```
Same goal: decrypt the target-bytes.

Stop and think for a second. |
---------------------------- |
What's harder than challenge #12 about doing this? How would you overcome that obstacle? The hint is: you're using all the tools you already have; no crazy math is required. |
Think "STIMULUS" and "RESPONSE". |

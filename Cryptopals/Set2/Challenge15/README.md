# [PKCS#7 padding validation](http://cryptopals.com/sets/2/challenges/15/)
Write a function that takes a plaintext, determines if it has valid PKCS#7 padding, and strips the padding off.

The string:
```
"ICE ICE BABY\x04\x04\x04\x04"
```
... has valid padding, and produces the result "ICE ICE BABY".

The string:
```
"ICE ICE BABY\x05\x05\x05\x05"
```
... does not have valid padding, nor does:
```
"ICE ICE BABY\x01\x02\x03\x04"
```
If you are writing in a language with exceptions, like Python or Ruby, make your function throw an exception on bad padding.

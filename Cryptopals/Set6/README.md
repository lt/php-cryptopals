# [Crypto Challenge Set 6](http://cryptopals.com/sets/6/)
This is **the last of our original crypto challenges.**

This set exclusively covers **number-theoretic cryptography**, and, in particular, RSA and DSA.

This set is **hard**. The concepts are again new. The attacks involve some math --- but nothing you didn't learn in 9th grade --- and a significant amount of programming.

But **they're worth it**. Two of these attacks in particular are among the most valuable in real-world cryptography.

- [ ] 41. Implement unpadded message recovery oracle
- [ ] 42. Bleichenbacher's e=3 RSA Attack
- [ ] 43. DSA key recovery from nonce
- [ ] 44. DSA nonce recovery from repeated nonce
- [ ] 45. DSA parameter tampering
- [ ] 46. RSA parity oracle
- [ ] 47. Bleichenbacher's PKCS 1.5 Padding Oracle (Simple Case)
- [ ] 48. Bleichenbacher's PKCS 1.5 Padding Oracle (Complete Case)

# [DSA key recovery from nonce](http://cryptopals.com/sets/6/challenges/43/)
**Step 1:** Relocate so that you are out of easy travel distance of us.

**Step 2:** Implement DSA, up to signing and verifying, including parameter generation.

*Hah-hah you're too far away to come punch us.*

*Just kidding* you can skip the parameter generation part if you want; if you do, use these params:
```
 p = 800000000000000089e1855218a0e7dac38136ffafa72eda7
     859f2171e25e65eac698c1702578b07dc2a1076da241c76c6

("But I want smaller params!" Then generate them yourself.)

The DSA signing operation generates a random subkey "k". You know this because you implemented the DSA sign operation.

This is the first and easier of two challenges regarding the DSA "k" subkey.

Given a known "k", it's trivial to recover the DSA private key "x":
```
          (s * k) - H(msg)
      x = ----------------  mod q
                  r
```
Do this a couple times to prove to yourself that you grok it. Capture it in a function of some sort.

Now then. I used the parameters above. I generated a keypair. My pubkey is:
```
  y = 84ad4719d044495496a3201c8ff484feb45b962e7302e56a392aee4
      abab3e4bdebf2955b4736012f21a08084056b19bcd7fee56048e004

```
I signed

(My SHA1 for this string was *d2d0714f014a9784047eaeccf956520045c45265*; I don't know what NIST wants you to do, but when I convert that hash to an integer I get: *0xd2d0714f014a9784047eaeccf956520045c45265*).

I get:
```
  r = 548099063082341131477253921760299949438196259240
  s = 857042759984254168557880549501802188789837994940
```
I signed this string with a broken implemention of DSA that generated "k" values between 0 and 2^16. What's my private key?

Its SHA-1 fingerprint (after being converted to hex) is:
```
0954edd5e0afe5542a4adf012611a91912a3ec16
```
Obviously, it also generates the same signature for that string.

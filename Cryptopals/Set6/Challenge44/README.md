# [DSA nonce recovery from repeated nonce](http://cryptopals.com/sets/6/challenges/44/)
Cryptanalytic MVP award. |
------------------------ |
This attack (in an elliptic curve group) broke the PS3. It is a great, great attack. |

[In this file find a collection of DSA-signed messages](44.txt). (NB: each msg has a trailing space.)

These were signed under the following pubkey:
```
y = 2d026f4bf30195ede3a088da85e398ef869611d0f68f07
    13d51c9c1a3a26c95105d915e2d8cdf26d056b86b8a7b8

    f98a6a4d83d8279ee65d71c1203d2c96d65ebbf7cce9d3
    2971c3de5084cce04a2e147821
```
(using the same domain parameters as the previous exercise)

It should not be hard to find the messages for which we have accidentally used a repeated "k". Given a pair of such messages, you can discover the "k" we used with the following formula:
```
         (m1 - m2)
     k = --------- mod q
         (s1 - s2)
```

If you want to demystify this, work out that equation from the original DSA equations. |

Basic cyclic group math operations want to screw you |
---------------------------------------------------- |
Remember all this math is mod q; s2 may be larger than s1, for instance, which isn't a problem if you're doing the subtraction mod q. If you're like me, you'll definitely lose an hour to forgetting a paren or a mod q. (And don't forget that modular inverse function!) |

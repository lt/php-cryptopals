# Crypto Challenge Set 5
This is the first set of **number-theoretic cryptography** challenges, and also our coverage of message authentication.

This set is **significantly harder** than the last set. The concepts are new, the attacks bear no resemblance to those of the previous sets, and... math.

On the other hand, **our favorite cryptanalytic attack ever** is in this set (you'll see it soon). We're happy with this set. Don't wimp out here. You're almost done!

33\. Implement Diffie-Hellman
34\. Implement a MITM key-fixing attack on Diffie-Hellman with parameter injection
35\. Implement DH with negotiated groups, and break with malicious "g" parameters
36\. Implement Secure Remote Password (SRP)
37\. Break SRP with a zero key
38\. Offline dictionary attack on simplified SRP
39\. Implement RSA
40\. Implement an E=3 RSA Broadcast attack
